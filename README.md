# Stat628-Module2-Group21
This project is the coursework for stat 628, in which we built a body fat percentage calculator through a data set with 252 males body features. you can find the final app of our calculator at [Body Fat Calculator](https://jiawei98.shinyapps.io/BodyFatUI/).

## Image
This folder contains figures produced in our analysis.

* Histogram of Body Fat.png is the histogram of Bodyfat for the raw data.
* Boxplot of Body Fat Divided By Age.png is the boxplot of Bodyfat divided by age for the raw data.
* Density of Independent Variables Devided By Age.png contains the density plots for several independent variables.
* Dotplot of Forearm And Bodyfat.png and Dotplot of Weight And Bodyfat.png are the dotplots for corresponding variables.
* Correlation Plot.png is the correlation plot for all variables in the raw data.

## Summary
Nameofsummaryfile is an summary of what we did. The results shows that the percentage of body fat of a male is can be predicted by *Weight*, *Abdomen* and *Wrist circum*.

There are four folders providing more details in our main project, *code*, *image*, *data*.

## Code
The provided R code file contains three parts:

* Data description and cleaning part, in which we illustrated the distributions and relationships among these variables and dropped unreasonable observations.
* Model selection part, in which we built several models, compared their validities and then made a choice.
* Model diagnosis part, in which we assess the assumptions and check the robustness, accuracy and speed.


## Data
*BodyFat.csv* is the rawdata for our study.

*BodyFat_new.Rdata* is the csv file after data cleaning.
