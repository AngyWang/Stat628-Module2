 Histogram plot and box plot for body fat is provided. Histogram of Body Fat.png is the histogram of Bodyfat for the raw data. `Boxplot of Body Fat Divided By Age.png` is the boxplot of Bodyfat divided by age for the raw data.

- Density plots and dotplots for explanatory variables are utilized. `Density of Independent Variables Devided By Age.png` contains the density plots for several independent variables. `Dotplot of Forearm And Bodyfat.png` and `Dotplot of Weight And Bodyfat.png` are the dotplots for corresponding variables.

- To check for multicollinearity, we also plotted the correlation plot. `Correlation Plot.png` is the correlation plot for all variables in the raw data.

* Cross Validation results can be found in `Cross Validation Result For Simplest Model.png`, `Cross Validation Result For BIC Selected Model.png` and `Cross Validation Result For Final Model.png`.
* The fitted result can be seen from `Fitted Value vs Original Value.png`, in which we compare the fitted values and the original data.
