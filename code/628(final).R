#Step 1  Analyzing Raw Data

data<-read.csv("BodyFat.csv")
#We first look into the Bodyfat data.
head(sort(data$BODYFAT))
tail(sort(data$BODYFAT))
#Ok, we find there is an extreme data whose bodyfat is 0, so we delete it.
data<-data[-which(data$BODYFAT==0),]
#Second, we look into WEIGHT data
head(sort(data$WEIGHT))
tail(sort(data$WEIGHT))
#Then we first find there is an extreme data whose WEIGHT is 363.1, it's too high, so we delete it.
data<-data[-which(data$WEIGHT==363.15),]
#Third, we look into HEIGHT data
head(sort(data$HEIGHT))
tail(sort(data$HEIGHT))
#There is an outlier which is too small, so we delete it.
data<-data[-which(data$HEIGHT==29.50),]
#Then we use summary and see that the data is fine, no obvious outliers.
summary(data)
#Now let's use BMI to see whether there are some outliers.
BMI<-data$WEIGHT/(data$HEIGHT)^2 #This is the formula of BMI
plot(BMI,data$ADIPOSITY,xlab = "BMI",ylab = "ADIPOSITY")
#Ok, we find 2 points that are extreme points, now we can get their No.
#identify(x=BMI,y=data$ADIPOSITY,n=2)
#Then we will delete them.
data<-data[-218,]
data<-data[-161,]
#Now we use another method: siri equation to detect the extreme points.

#Ok, we find 3 points that are extreme points, now we can get their No.

#Then we delete them

anova(model_1st,model_square,model_2nd)
#by the summary we can find that the adj R square doesn't change too much, so we know that the model with square would be better by the result of anova.

#Next we use all the variables except the ADIPOSITY to do the model because it has relation with HEIGHT and WEIGHT. This is our model 2
